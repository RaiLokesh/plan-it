# plan-it
Assignment Shedular app.

Hey there!
In this covid time our classes were made online, so it was really difficult to keep manually track of all assignments, we were recieving from college, 
so I decided to create this app, in which I can schedule all my assignments and keep the track of it.

Version 1.0 is released, will be adding more features as and when required. Feel free to suggest any improvements.
